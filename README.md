The project was created and edited in PyCharm, I didn't tried to see if it works on other platforms (as VsCode), but it works fine on PyCharm.
In the "main.py" file you can find which libraries were used.
The "myapp.kv" file contains the code for the interface and its features (interactive blocks like buttons, search bar).
The "data.json" represents the app's database.
